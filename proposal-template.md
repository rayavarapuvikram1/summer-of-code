# Title

MicroPython examples and tools for Portenta H7.

## Abstract

Portenta H7 is a multiprocessor microcomputer which can run multiple tasks at once. MicroPython helps in building tools and programming this board.

## Technical Details

We can implement the tools with the help of MicroPython. It has lightweight libraries and easy to interact with the hardware components.

## Deliverables

1. Board Setup
    1. Learning and Practicing MicroPython.
    2. Interfacing the external peripherals with Portenta.
    3. Debugging interface with external peripherals.

2. Examples of MicroPython for Portenta
    1. Creating a Github Repository for hosting the examples.
    2. Converting standard Arduino examples into MicroPython for Protenta.

3. Tools for Portenta
    1. Implementation of Bluetooth low energy device scanner and interface with Portenta board.
    2. Implementation of tools like Nmap, Wireshark which enables the board to use for pen-testing purposes also.

### **Community Bonding Period**

- In the community bonding period, I will be getting familiar with the programming style guide that your organization uses.

- Discussion and planning work with a mentor.

- Planning for weekly calls/meetings to discuss weekly works and updates of work.

### **Phase 1**  Deliverable before the first Mid-Term evaluation

- Debugging interface with external peripherals with MicroPython on Protenta
- Examples on interfacing with hardware components

### **Phase 2**  Deliverable before the second Mid-Term evaluation

- Implementation of Bluetooth Low Energy **_(B.L.E.)_** device scanner and interface with the Portenta board.
- Examples on how to use the **B.L.E.** interface tool.

### **Final Week**

- Implementation of tools like Nmap, Wireshark which enables the board to use for pen-testing purposes also.

- Making the final documentation of tools and linking it with the examples written so that a beginner can understand

## Development Experience

Yes, I code on Github. Here are some of my contributions.  

 1. [Making Presentation slider with Mi Band](https://github.com/rayavarapuvikram1/Miband3-1/commit/9752aab31ae7379fe1515b72af1860d010716a13)  
 2. [Voice Assistant (Alexis)](https://github.com/bradtraversy/alexis_speech_assistant/commit/2159d2df1cbcce150677be57100cbca98d1b6d12)  

 Below are some of the projects I made with Arduino and NodeMCU.  

  1. [Tap Keyboard (Keyboard for blind)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13e-IX5ErIRb9sRcOonFVntmrxVZ5qDYv/view?usp=sharing)

## Other Experiences

- Part of the Web Application Team at Reliance Industries Limited (R.I.L.)  
- Programmer and Project Designer at RnD CCA, NIT Durgapur

## Why this project?

I like to work on hardware development. My interests and experience and knowledge made me chose this project.

## Do you have any other commitments during the GSoC period?

During GSOC I don't have any other commitments. Due to COVID 19 if there is a reschedule my academic examination I may need a break of 15 days.
